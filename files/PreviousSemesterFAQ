Assignment 4 – FAQ’s

1. I can’t beat the unit tests for vectorized speed because my local machine is slow, should I be worried?

Just make sure your vectorized speeds are faster than the naive implementation (e.g., for loops) by a significant margin, and your grades should be fine in gradescope. Also, note that you are allowed to use any numpy function necessary to achieve the necessary speed advantage.

2. What is the difference between Gini Gain and Information Gain?

Gini Gain computes the difference in Gini Impurity instead of computing the differences in entropy across splits: https://victorzhou.com/blog/gini-impurity/

3. Am I allowed to split on the same attribute more than once?

Yes - The metric/threshold you decide to split on may change at different parts of the tree

4. For random forests, should I subsample my data points with or without replacement?

You should sample with replacement as this keeps the total number of possible dataset combinations higher.

5. For random forests, should I subsample my features with or without replacement?

You should sample your features without replacement. Identical features will not help you split the data any better

6. Do I need to submit my notebooks also?

Nope, not at all. It’s just a convenient organization of unit tests. Visualization notebook is also for your convenience, you don’t have to submit any notebook.

7. Vectorized Mask function is failing ?

Please do not change the input data. Make a new array based on the values in the data array and the threshold and return that new array. 



Notes:

1. Make sure you account for divide by 0 cases in Gini and your performance metrics

2. During real training, it is normally not desirable for training performance to be 100%, as that indicates overfitting

3. If you are running out of time/memory, make sure your depth limit is not just set to infinity
